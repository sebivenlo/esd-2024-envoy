<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">To start with the workshop, please clone this repository.</p>

After that, open the repository in Visual Studio Code and wait for the "Re-open in Container" prompt. If the prompt never comes up, hit 
```CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+P ``` to bring up the command palette and look for "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container".

From there, continue in the README ( needs to be linked) which is available in the ```code``` (```app``` in docker) directory.
